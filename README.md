## Environment Profiles

- **Development (dev):**
  - Configuration optimized for local development.
  - Debugging enabled, comprehensive logging for ease of troubleshooting.
  - Configuration file: `application-dev.properties`

- **Quality Assurance (qa):**
  - Configuration tailored for testing environments.
  - Increased security measures and optimized settings for QA testing.
  - Configuration file: `application-qa.properties`

- **Production (prod):**
  - Configuration optimized for a production environment.
  - High-security measures and performance enhancements.
  - Configuration file: `application-prod.properties`

## Authentication and Authorization

- JWT tokens are used for secure user authentication.
- Authorization mechanisms ensure that users have the right privileges for their roles.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on AWS for optimal performance and scalability. Follow these steps to deploy the application locally or on your own AWS environment.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Choose the appropriate environment configuration file based on your deployment scenario:
   - For local development: `application-dev.properties`
   - For QA testing: `application-qa.properties`
   - For production deployment: `application-prod.properties`
3. Rename the chosen configuration file to `application.properties`.
4. Configure the `application.properties` file with your environment-specific settings.
5. Build and deploy the application.

For AWS deployment, ensure that you have the necessary AWS credentials and permissions.

## Bean Validation

Bean validation is applied to enforce data integrity and validate user inputs, preventing invalid data from entering the system.

## Database Mappings

The application uses industry-standard database mappings to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval. Entity relationships are well-defined for a structured and normalized database schema.

## Role-Based Authorization

Role-based authorization is implemented to manage user access rights. Roles are assigned based on user privileges, ensuring a secure and controlled environment.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend Framework:** [Spring Boot]
- **Database:** [MySQL]
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Deployment:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- **Validation:** Bean Validation
- **Role-Based Authorization:** Yes
